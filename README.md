## User Stories

US1: As a random visitor, I want to be able to register an account or log-in, so I can
access all features

US2: As a random visitor, I want to be redirected to the login/register page when I click on “location" tab, so that I know I must log-in to see its content

US3: As a logged-in user, I want to see locations and be able to click on one location to open a modal containing details, so that the website is useful

US4: As an “admin" user, I want to see a “Add Location” button in the location page, so that I can create a new location

US5: As an “admin" user, I want to see a button to edit locations in the array of locations, so that I can edit existing locations

US6: As an “admin" user, I want to see a button to delete locations in the array of locations so that I can delete existing locations

I had an issue to edit, create and delete locations from the admin user. The front is created but not always working. 
The other features are 100% working. 
When you run the app for the first time there will be an issue but you just have to navigate on the nav bar to fix it.
